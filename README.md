**This repository contains a variety of materials (source code, documentation bits, benchmarks and reports) related to exploitation of modern [OverlayFS](https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/overlayfs.html) features in [CVMFS](https://github.com/cvmfs/cvmfs). The work was done during the course of CERN Ukrainian Students Remote Program.
Currently, the following features are under research:**
- [Metadata copy only (metacopy=on feature)](https://github.com/YBelikov/cvmfs-overlayfs/blob/main/METACOPY.md)
- Zero-copy directory renames
